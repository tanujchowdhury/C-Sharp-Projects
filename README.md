# C# Projects

These are some small projects I made using C# and .NET Framework

## Projects:
* [Car Insurance](https://github.com/tanujchowdhury/C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/CarInsurance)
* [Server Time](https://tanujservertimewebapp6795.azurewebsites.net/ServerTime)

### Car Insurance
This project is an MVC web app that mimics a car insurance administrator website. It takes user's input on policy information and gererates a quote based on business logic. It also features an admin page where all generated quotes can be viewed.

### Server Time
This is a basic web application hosted in Azure. It displays the current time of the server and displays a greeting based on the time of day. I will add other features to this web app in the future.
