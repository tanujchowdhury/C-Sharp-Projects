### Twenty One Game
This project is a console application in which the user can play blackjack againt the dealer. The dealer's actions are all controlled by the program while the user can choose how much to bet and if they want to "hit" or "stay". There are protections in place so that the user can't cheat the casino.

### Car Insurance
This project is an MVC web app that mimics a car insurance administrator website. It takes user's input on policy information and gererates a quote based on business logic. It also features an admin page where all generated quotes can be viewed.

### Server Time
This is a basic web application hosted in Azure. It displays the current time of the server and displays a greeting based on the time of day.
